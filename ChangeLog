	37. idl interfaces are now wrapped into module hppCorbaServer. 
	36. Changed the names of the Corba context and servants. Name of context is now
	    hpp.plannerContext
	    Names of servants are
	    ChppciRobot: robots.servant
	    ChppciObstacle: obstacles.servant
	    ChppciProblem: problems.servant

	35. Added requests in ChppciObstacleServer to control obstacles transparency and visibility.
	34. Changed the way dof bounds are handled at creation of a joint.

2008/05/01
	33. Added boolean parameter in ChppciProblem::setRoadmapbuilder to select whether 
	    roadmap developed by new roadmap builder should be displayed.
	
2008/04/25
	32. in ChppciServer objects, new distance function factories can be added.
	31. Added a CORBA request to set a distance function in a given roadmap builder.
	
2008/04/24
	30. Added a standalone CORBA server running without the interface.
	
2008/04/17
	29. If CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are not defined at configuration, they are set to "-Wall".

	28. Adaptation to KPP version 2.04.500.
	
2008/03/22
	27. ChppciServer object now builds a map of steering method factories referenced 
	by names. New steering methods can thus be added and set by CORBA request setSteeringMethod.

	26. Finer handling of exceptions in CORBA initialization. 
	
hpp-corbaserver 1.2 released February 18, 2008.

	25. Added two requests to make a joint visible or transparent.
	24. Unsuccessfully tried to destroy correctly Corba objects in
	    order to rebuild them but failed.
	23. Added recently developed roadmap builders in
	    ChppciProblem::setRoadmapbuilder.
	22. Remove reference to kwsPlusRoadmap.
	21. Do not delete attribute attHppPlanner at destruction of
	    ChppciServer.
	20. Correction of documentation generation related to previous
	    modification.
	19. Reorganization of header files to solve some compilation
	    problems.
	18. Adaptation to changes in hppCore.
	
hpp-corbaserver 1.1 released October 10, 2007.

	17. Added missing hppTools.h in EXTRA_DIST.
	16. Added CORBA requests to display a roadmap in the interface.
	15. Added a CORBA request to optimize a path.
	14. Renamed setJointLocked into setDofLocked.
	13. hppCorbaServer can now run with KPP interface without
	    crashing. The CORBA interface enables a user
	  - to build a robot joint by joint and body by body,
	  - to add and move obstacles
	  - to define initial and goal configurations and
	  - to solve a problem.
	12. Made corrections in interface implementation
	    ChppciRobotServer.idl to take into account the new version of
	    KineoPathPlanner. This had not been done.
	11. Added Reeds and Shepp local steering method.
	10. Create POA with PortableServer::MAIN_THREAD_MODEL as thread
	   policy in order to make main thread process corba requests.
	9. Requests of hppCorbaServer are treated sequentially in order to
	   avoid concurrent access problems.
	8. Methods loadRobotModel and loadObstacleModel of
	   ChppciOpenHrpClient now takes as optional input the prefix
	   where OpenHRP wrl files are installed.
	7. Added request initializeProblem.
	6. Added a request to create a box in obstacle server.
	5. Correction of a bug in Corba request that adds a polyhedron to
	   a list.
	
hpp-corbaserver 1.0 released August 27th, 2007.
	
	4. Replaced ChppPolyhedron by CkppKCDPolyhedron since they are the same.
	3. Replaced ChppDevice by CkppDeviceComponent since
	  1 ChppDevice derives from CkppDeviceComponent and
	  2 The operations performed on objects of this type only concern
	    CkppDeviceComponent part.
	2. Make dependence to OpenHRP conditional, as it was initially.
	1. Simplified a lot interfaces of ChppciOpenHrpClient: no more
	argc and argv. Only loadHrp2Model() has been tested.
